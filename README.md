# Edge Sample Traceback Security Simulation
The files are an example of performing the edge sample algorithm for traceback of packets from an attacker to the victim

Note: In order to run with the various topologies, you will need to copy the topology from the topology.txt file and paste it into the source code for the traceback.

## Note
This is a work in progress; I will be deprecating this version and rewritting from scratch in order to automate the network creation and simulation of attacker vs. victim.
